Below is a user guide for the BRM Tool application. This guide is written in a step-by-step manner so that both end-users (regular users) and administrators can quickly get started and master the main features of the tool.

BRM Tool User Guide

1. Introduction

BRM Tool is a PyQt5-based desktop application for managing business rules, users, groups, approvals, and backups. It uses an in-memory SQLite database (by default) with strong application-level enforcement of foreign keys and constraints. This ensures data integrity without relying on database triggers.

Key Features
	•	User Login with group-based permissions
	•	Business Rule Management (CRUD: create, read, update, delete)
	•	Group Management (admin-only)
	•	Multi-Step Approval Process for rules
	•	Custom Rule Groups for grouped rule subsets
	•	Backup and Restore for both business groups and custom rule groups
	•	Lineage Visualization to see rule dependencies and flows
	•	Audit Logging of all major CRUD operations

2. Getting Started

2.1 Prerequisites
	1.	Python 3.7+ installed on your system
	2.	PyQt5 and pyqtgraph libraries installed

pip install pyqt5 pyqtgraph


	3.	SQLite is embedded within Python, so no extra server setup is needed.

2.2 Running the Application
	1.	Clone or download the BRM Tool code.
	2.	Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the directory containing brmtool_pyqtgraph.py (or however your main file is named).

	•	Select a group in the combo box, view or modify Target Tables:
	•	Add Permission: Assign a new table to the selected group.
	•	Remove Permission: Remove a table permission from the group.

6.3 Approvers Management
	•	Each business group may have Approvers who participate in rule approvals.
	•	Add Approver: Enter a username who will serve as an approver for the group.
	•	Remove Approver: Remove an existing approver from the group.

7. Lineage Visualization

This tab shows a graph of your rules:
	1.	Nodes: Each rule is displayed either as a rectangle (for certain rule types) or ellipse.
	2.	Edges: Lines connecting parent rules to their child rules.
	3.	Interactive:
	•	Search bar allows you to find rules by name or column references.
	•	Highlight Ancestors or Highlight Descendants from the right-click context menu on a node.
	•	Reset View re-fits the entire graph to your window.
	•	Refresh Graph re-builds the lineage from the current database state.

When you left-click on a node, a Rule Details panel (dock widget) displays that rule’s basic metadata (ID, Name, Status, Type, etc.).

8. Custom Rule Groups

A Custom Rule Group is a user-defined grouping of rules that can belong to different owner groups.
	1.	Create Custom Group
	•	Enter a Custom Group Name in the text field at the top, then click “Create Custom Group.”
	2.	Manage Custom Groups
	•	A table lists existing custom groups with Group ID, Group Name, Owner BG.
	•	Selecting a custom group displays its current Rules on the right side.
	3.	Add or Remove Rules from a Custom Group
	•	Left side shows All Rules.
	•	Right side shows Rules in the selected custom group.
	•	Use the “Add Rule →” button to move selected rules into the custom group, or “← Remove Rule” to remove them.
	4.	Backup / Restore Custom Group
	•	Backup Custom Group: Creates a snapshot of all rules in that custom group.
	•	Restore Custom Group: Restores all rules in the custom group from a chosen backup version, overwriting existing ones.

9. Approvals

In the Approvals tab:
	1.	List of Pending Approvals for the logged-in user.
	2.	Each row shows the Rule ID, Group Name, Rule Name, Stage, Approved Flag, an Approve button, and a Pipeline visualization.
	3.	Click “Approve” to mark a rule as approved at your stage.
	4.	Once all required stages are approved, the rule becomes ACTIVE. Otherwise, it remains INACTIVE and APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS.

10. Global/Critical Admin (Admin Only)

Administrators can manage:
	1.	Search for rules by name or SQL snippet.
	2.	Mark or Unmark rules as Global or Critical:
	•	Global means the rule can be recognized as universally enforced, bypassing normal multi-step approvals if needed.
	•	Critical means it halts child rules if it fails.
	3.	Set Critical Scope (NONE, GROUP, CLUSTER, GLOBAL) on multiple selected rules.
	4.	Link Child Rule for global/critical parent rule relationships.
	5.	Unlink Child Rule to remove that relationship.

11. Control Tables

This tab provides direct viewing (read-only) of all underlying database tables. You can select any table name in the dropdown to view its contents. It’s primarily for debugging or inspecting how data is stored under the hood.

12. Audit Logs

Throughout the application, any create, update, or delete operation is recorded in the BRM_AUDIT_LOG table. You can view these logs via:
	•	“View Audit Logs” button (in the Business Rule Management tab), or
	•	Directly from the Audit Log Viewer if you integrate that in your UI.

Columns:
	•	ACTION: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
	•	TABLE_NAME: Name of the table modified (e.g., BRM_RULES, USERS).
	•	RECORD_ID: The primary key (ID) of the affected record.
	•	ACTION_BY: Username or group performing the action.
	•	OLD_DATA: JSON with the record’s previous state (for UPDATE/DELETE).
	•	NEW_DATA: JSON with the record’s new state (for INSERT/UPDATE).
	•	ACTION_TIMESTAMP: When the action happened.

13. Troubleshooting
	1.	Cannot Delete a Rule
	•	Ensure it’s INACTIVE and APPROVAL_STATUS=APPROVED.
	•	Make sure it has no active child rules or references in BRM_COLUMN_MAPPING.
	2.	Cannot Delete a Group
	•	Confirm no users are assigned to the group.
	•	If the group has associated rules, ensure they’re assigned to a different OWNER_GROUP first or delete those rules.
	3.	Approvals Not Advancing
	•	Check if all current-stage approvers have approved the rule.
	•	Ensure the rule’s APPROVAL_STATUS is still APPROVAL_IN_PROGRESS. If all are approved, it becomes APPROVED.
	4.	Lineage Graph Doesn’t Show All Changes
	•	Click “Refresh Graph” in the Lineage Visualization tab to reload the latest data.
	•	Make sure your rules were saved or updated properly.
	5.	Foreign Key Error
	•	This usually occurs if you attempt to reference a non-existent record or delete an entity that still has child references. Check the related entities or reassign them first.

14. Best Practices and Tips
	•	Run the Application Regularly: Because the database is in-memory by default, data resets each time you close the tool unless you modify the DB_URI to point to a file-based SQLite DB.
	•	Use Backup and Restore: If you care about the changes persisting, make frequent backups of your groups or custom groups, especially before major modifications.
	•	Keep Credentials Secure: If you introduce new users, ensure you don’t store passwords in plain text for production usage. (The demo uses plain text for illustration.)
	•	Don’t Rely on Work-In-Progress Approvals: If a rule is partially approved, do not forcibly set it to ACTIVE. The system’s multi-step approval logic automatically determines when a rule is fully approved.

15. Conclusion

The BRM Tool integrates robust data integrity (via application-level checks and foreign key constraints), audit logging, and a rich UI for business rule management. By following the steps in this guide, you should be able to:
	1.	Log in and manage business rules.
	2.	Create or update rules with enforced approvals.
	3.	Backup and restore groups or custom rule groups.
	4.	Visualize rule lineage and dependencies.
	5.	Use advanced functionalities like multi-step approvals and global/critical rule administration.

If you have any questions, issues, or enhancement requests, refer to the Troubleshooting section first, or consult with your system administrator or development team.

Happy rule management!
