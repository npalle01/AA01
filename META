Slide 1: Title & Introduction

Title:
Enhancing Efficiency with Automated Technical Metadata

Subtitle:
Improving Regulatory Reporting and Streamlining Release Management

Speaker Note (Optional):
Welcome the audience, provide quick context on the importance of data lineage, business rules, and regulatory reporting challenges.

Slide 2: Business Challenge – The Starting Point

No Clear Impact Analysis: Prior to automation, there was little to no visibility into how each change in data structures (e.g., tables and columns) affected regulatory reports.
Limited Testing Confidence: UAT phases lacked proper guidance on which areas needed specific focus or testing due to changes.
Dependency on Tech Teams: Business and operations heavily relied on technology teams for root cause analysis (RCA) and feasibility checks.
Manual Effort & Delays: Manual processes were time-consuming, prone to error, and created bottlenecks during release cycles.
Speaker Note:
Highlight how these challenges resulted in inefficient reporting cycles and potential compliance risks.

Slide 3: The Automated Solution

Automated Technical Metadata:
Captures data lineage, mapping each column to its source and transformation rules.
Documents business rules directly linked to data elements.
Release-Based Impact Alerts:
For every new release, the system automatically identifies the impacted tables and columns.
Notifies stakeholders about the type of change (Update, Delete, New Addition).
Regulatory Report Impact Analysis:
Flags which regulatory reports (e.g., related to credit risk exposure) will be affected by the changes.
Provides insight into how each column’s derivation or calculations will be altered.
Streamlined Notification Mechanism:
Automated alerts and dashboards ensure users are informed in real-time, reducing reliance on manual updates.
Speaker Note:
Explain how this automation closes the gap between data changes and business reporting needs.

Slide 4: How It Works – A Simplified Process Flow

1. Data Collection & Ingestion

Metadata about tables, columns, and transformations is continuously updated.
2. Automated Analysis

System compares previous release to the upcoming release, identifying deltas and potential conflicts.
3. Impact Alert Generation

Alerts are generated, detailing specific changes (new, modified, or removed).
Includes the direct correlation to impacted regulatory reports.
4. Report & Dashboard

Stakeholders access an intuitive dashboard summarizing all changes, impacts, and recommended action items.
(Include a simple flow diagram if possible)

Slide 5: Key Benefits & Value Proposition

Enhanced Transparency
Clear lineage and business rule documentation reduce confusion and errors.
Reduced Manual Effort
Automated alerts save significant time by highlighting only relevant changes for review.
Improved Compliance
Faster, more accurate impact analysis ensures alignment with regulatory requirements for credit risk exposure.
Accelerated UAT & Release Cycles
Focused testing on impacted areas speeds up overall development and deployment processes.
Lower Operational Costs
Decreased reliance on technology teams for root cause analysis and feasibility checks.
Speaker Note:
Emphasize the direct gains in efficiency, risk reduction, and overall cost savings.

Slide 6: Before & After Snapshot

Aspect	Before Automation	After Automation
Impact Analysis	No visibility into affected reports	Automatic alerts with specific tables & columns changes
UAT Testing	Reactive, guess-based approach	Proactive, targeted testing based on real-time impact alerts
Dependency on Tech Teams	High – for RCA, feasibility, and lineage information	Reduced – business now self-serves through dashboards & automated reports
Manual Effort	Significant – manual reviews, cross-checks, email communications	Minimal – system-generated, consolidated reporting
