Slide 1: Title & Introduction

Title:
Enhancing Credit Risk Reporting with Automated Technical Metadata

Subtitle:
Streamlining Data Lineage, Audit Logging, and Decommissioning for Credit Limit Monitoring

Speaker Notes:

Briefly welcome the audience: credit risk managers, analysts, and stakeholders.
Introduce the need for accurate, real-time data in credit risk reporting and credit limit monitoring.
Slide 2: The Business Challenge

Header: Challenges in Credit Risk Data & Reporting

Lack of Clear Impact Analysis: Unclear how data changes affect credit risk reports and credit limit calculations.
Insufficient Audit Trails: Difficulty in tracing who changed what and when across multiple releases.
Unused Data Assets: Tables and columns no longer needed clutter the data environment, creating confusion and potential compliance risks.
Dependency on Technology Teams: Business owners rely on tech teams for root cause analysis (RCA) and feasibility checks.
Manual Effort & Delays: Time-consuming processes cause reporting lags and compliance risks.
Speaker Notes:

Stress how these pain points can lead to suboptimal credit limit decisions and regulatory compliance challenges.
Slide 3: The Automated Metadata & Lineage Solution

Automated Technical Metadata:
Continuously captures data lineage, including source-to-target mappings and business rule transformations.
Audit Logging & Change History:
Every modification is logged, showing who made the change, when, and how it impacts credit reporting structures.
Impact Alerts for Releases:
Automatically flags table/column changes (added, modified, deleted) with direct links to the credit risk reports.
Decommissioning Insights:
Identifies unused or redundant tables and columns for potential retirement, simplifying future data management.
Speaker Notes:

Emphasize how each element reduces manual discovery and supports confident decision-making in credit risk.
Slide 4: Why It Matters for Credit Risk & Credit Limit Monitoring

Header: Value Proposition for Business Owners

Accurate Exposure Reporting: Ensures that all data driving credit limit calculations is current and traceable.
Regulatory Compliance: Automated lineage and audit logs help meet stringent governance and reporting standards.
Real-Time Alerts: Quick detection of data changes that might distort credit exposure metrics.
Streamlined Decommissioning: Removing unused data assets reduces confusion, leading to more efficient credit evaluations.
Improved Accountability: Audit logs provide an end-to-end trail for internal controls and regulatory audits.
Speaker Notes:

Tie each benefit to a real-world credit risk scenario (e.g., adjusting a corporate clientâ€™s credit limit on time).
Slide 5: Process Flow Overview

(A simple diagram or flowchart can be added here.)

Metadata & Audit Data Ingestion
Collect table schemas, columns, lineage, and record all changes in an audit log.
Automated Analysis
System identifies new/updated/deleted data objects and flags unused assets.
Impact Alert Generation
Sends automated alerts to credit risk teams with details on changes affecting exposure and limit calculations.
Decision & Reporting
Credit risk owners use interactive dashboards to validate changes, adjust credit limits, or retire obsolete data objects.
Speaker Notes:

Note how each step accelerates UAT and ongoing operations for credit risk owners.
Slide 6: Key Benefits & Metrics

Enhanced Compliance & Auditability
Reduced manual effort; clear historical logs of every data change.
Faster Credit Limit Updates
Automated alerts enable quicker recalibration of credit limits when data shifts.
Fewer Errors in Credit Exposure Reports
Proactive notification of column/table changes leading to fewer reconciliation issues.
Reduction in Data Bloat
Retiring unused tables and columns leads to a cleaner data environment and faster processing.
Increased Transparency
Business owners gain direct insights into how each column is derived and used in credit metrics.
Speaker Notes:

Where possible, include specific numbers or percentages showing improvements in time savings, error reductions, or compliance milestones.
Slide 7: Before & After Comparison

Aspect	Before Automation	After Automation
Credit Risk Reporting	Manual tracing of data changes led to delayed or incomplete reporting	Automated lineage clarifies where data comes from, enabling timely updates
Audit Logging	Inconsistent, scattered logs with minimal insight	Centralized audit logs track every change for accountability and compliance
Decommissioning	Unused tables/columns go unnoticed, wasting resources and risking outdated references	Proactive identification of redundant data, enabling orderly retirement
Testing & Release	Guesswork in UAT, often missing critical changes affecting credit limit calculations	Targeted testing, focusing on alerts for changed fields or new tables
Business Autonomy	High reliance on tech teams for RCA and data lineage questions	Business owners can self-serve through dashboards, reducing turnaround times
Speaker Notes:

Emphasize the transformation in data governance and the tangible impact on credit risk monitoring.
